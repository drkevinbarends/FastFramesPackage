# FastFrames

FastFrames is a package aimed at processing ntuples produced by [TopCPToolkit](https://topcptoolkit.docs.cern.ch/), or a similar CP algorithm based framework, into histograms or ntuples.
FastFrames rely on ROOT's [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) to do the event loop processing.
The code allows users to define their own columns in a minimal way while using all the functionality of the processing.
