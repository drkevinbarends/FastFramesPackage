# Config file settings

The config file consists of several blocks.
Available options for each block are documented bellow. Using an option which is not supported will result in error message and program termination.
The options are case sensitive. Example config files can be found in ```test/configs/```.

## `numbering_sequence` block inside of `systematics`, `Variable` or `histograms_2d` blocks

In order to automatically add multiple variables, systematic uncertainties or 2D histograms, one can use ```numbering_sequence``` block.
It contains list of dictionaries, each of them having the values defined in the table before. If you want to add for example pT of first 4 jets in an event, you can use just one block and put ```numbering_sequence``` inside it to achieve it. You can also use it when producing migration matrices or 2D histograms. If you define multiple dictionaries inside the ```numbering_sequence``` block, it will create a nested loop over all combinations.

| **Option**        | **Value type**    | **Function** |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| replacement_string| string            | If the string is found in ```up``` or ```down``` options (as well as in corresponding sum of weights or weight_suffix) for the systematic variations, it will be replaced by the number. This will add new systematics for each value from min to max (including), where the replacement string will be replaced by the integer number (see lines bellow). Alternativelly, one can specify directly the list of values to be used for replacement |
| min               | int               | Minimal value of the number in the name that should be used for the replacement.   |
| max               | int               | Maximal value of the number in the name that should be used for the replacement.   |
| values            | list of strings   | This can be used instead of ```min``` and ```max``` options, to define a sequence of values to use for replacement, for example ```["170", "172.5", "175"]``` |

## `simple_onnx_inference` block settings

| **Option**        | **Value type**    | **Function** |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |

| model_paths       | list of strings   | Paths to the ONNX model files for different folds in k-fold validation. Number of folds is determined by the length of this list, and the fold id is given by `eventNumber % nFolds`. |
| inputs            | list of dicts     | Mapping between the input layer names and the lists of input columns to feed into the correspondinf layer. Only `float32` columns are supported. |
| outputs           | list of dicts     | Mapping between the output layer names and the lists of output columns to create from the corresponding layer. Use a blank string in this list to skip creating a corresponding output column. |

### Example

For a set of ONNX models with one dense input layer `args_0` of size 4 and one dense output layer `softmax_output` of size 3, this config block would look like this. The model output is a `float32` array of length 3, however only the first and third elements are exported as two output coulumns.
```
general:
  ...
  define_custom_columns:
    - name: "only_el_pt_NOSYS"
      definition: "el_pt_NOSYS[0]"
    - name: "only_el_eta_NOSYS"
      definition: "el_eta[0]"

simple_onnx_inference:
  - name: "MVA_model_1"
    model_paths: [
      "/path/to/the/model_fold_0.onnx",
      "/path/to/the/model_fold_1.onnx"
    ]
    inputs:
      "args_0": ["only_el_pt_NOSYS", "only_el_eta_NOSYS", "met_met_NOSYS", "met_phi_NOSYS"]
    outputs:
      "softmax_output": ["signal_score_NOSYS", "", "bkg2_score_NOSYS"]
```
